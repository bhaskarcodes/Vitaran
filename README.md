<b>Problem Statement</b>  
A lot of people go hungry due to poverty and lack of food, or go cold due to lack of proper clothing, while there are people who have ample of it, and do not know what to do with it.    
There is plenty of resources for everyone, but not properly distributed.    
There is a lack of proper medium of distribution of resources, a medium to take the excess resources and bring it to the needy.  



<b>Solution Statement</b>   
To create an application, where the people who have material in excess can put up their availability status.
At a certain time of the day, a notification about the total items available is sent to the collecting party (NGOs/Orphanages) who would be given location of all the items, from where they can collect.
This would save their expenditure of purchase, and the only thing they would have to pay for is transportation.
